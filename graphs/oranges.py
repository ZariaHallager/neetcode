# Rotting Fruit

# Hints
# You are given a 2-D matrix grid. Each cell can have one of three possible values:

# 0 representing an empty cell
# 1 representing a fresh fruit
# 2 representing a rotten fruit
# Every minute, if a fresh fruit is horizontally or vertically adjacent to a rotten fruit, then the fresh fruit also becomes rotten.

# Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until there are zero fresh fruits remaining. If this state is impossible within the grid, return -1.

# Example 1:



# Input: grid = [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,2]]

# Output: 4
# Example 2:

# Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,2,0],[1,0,1]]

# Output: -1
# Constraints:

# 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 10

# 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
